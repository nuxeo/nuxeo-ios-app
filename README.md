Nuxeo Drive iOS Edition
-----------------------
nuxeo-ios-app repository hosts the sources of an iPad application that connects to any Nuxeo Server > 5.8 (preferably 5.9.3) for letting the user
- browse online all the Nuxeo Platform repository content, and preview it/open it with native iPad apps
- synchronize content that has been flagged to be so, either from the iPad app, or from the web application, using the Nuxeo Drive sync user action. This feature allows to embed on the iPad any document you need to access offline, may it be a video, an office file or a picture.
